# MAE-598-Design-Optimization
## Young's Modulus Prediction
### Introduction
In this application, you will learn how to use Keras backend Tensorflow to predict Young's Modulus of Sandstone structures through a
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

### Get Ready
#### Jupyter Notebook
This code is written in Jupyter Notebook, which is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code. Please download and install it, and for new users we highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)(Python 3.6 version). 

After installing, launching the jupyter notebook by running by typing in a terminal:

'''
jupyter notebook
'''

and find your target folder. Or you can 'cd' to your target folder in the terminal and then type 'jupyter notebook' command.

Once it's done, please follow the following steps to run this code.
1. Download this repo
2. Install TensorFlow [CPU version](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
3. Once done, use the terminal to go to the folder where where you hold this code, type in

'''
pip install -r requirement.txt
'''

This should install all dependancies.
