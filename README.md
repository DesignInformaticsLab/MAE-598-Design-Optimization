## MAE301 Neural Network Tutorial

### Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Keras (with Tensorflow backend) 
to create a convolutional neural network that predicts Young's Modulus of Sandstone 
structures.

### Get Ready
#### Jupyter Notebook
This code is written in Jupyter Notebook, which is an open-source 
web application that allows you to create and share documents that 
contain live code, please download and install it. For new users we 
highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

After installing, launch the jupyter notebook by typing in ```anaconda prompt``` in the search field under start menu and then type in:
```
jupyter notebook
```
and find your target folder. Or you can 'cd' to your target folder in 
the terminal and then type ```jupyter notebook```.

Once it's done, please follow the following steps to run this code.
1. Install TensorFlow [CPU version](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
2. Download this repo
3. Once done, use the terminal to go to the folder where you hold this 
code, type in

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
##### if it's not successful, you may try install the dependancies mannually by:
1. Run a terminal(type in ```cmd``` in the search field under start menu)
2. type in ``` pip install matplotlib ``` Enter
3. type in ``` pip install keras ``` Enter
4. type in ``` pip install sklearn ``` Enter

This should install all dependencies.

Once all is done, please open ```Young's Modulus Prediction_student.ipynb```.
